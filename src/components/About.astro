        Since technology has always been one of my passions, choosing this field
        was an easy decision. I was eager to learn how to <strong
          >create software
        </strong> and how to solve <strong>complex problems</strong>.

        Initially, I expected to gain mostly hard skills like programming and
        math during my studies. However, I have come to realize that the most
        valuable lessons were in soft skills such as <strong

        and its profound impact on our lives.

        During these years, I sought out as much real-world experience as
        possible. I took initial steps towards freelancing, which initially
        ended in failure. While I had a <strong>solid foundation</strong>, I
        lacked the necessary know-how and experience.
