        So, I entered the corporate world. Surrounded by people with more
        knowledge than me, I have spent over <strong>seven years</strong> honing
        my software development skills. Working on various projects has taught me
        to work within <strong>time and budget constraints</strong>, conduct
        <strong>research</strong> to tackle new challenges, and consistently <strong
          >bring value</strong
        > to customers and stakeholders.
